Chat filter addon for 3.3.5a World of Warcraft targeting players that look for PUG's.

# to open just type /LSR
- you can change the size of the window by right-click-drag on the background
- you can click on the player names in the window to start a whisper to them
- "play sound" plays the sound you hear when you accept a quest (this is played on new messages that match your search/renew of messages) 
- it watches every message that you receive, but you still cannot leave e.g. /global, but you can have the global chat in a spearate chat tab and it will be tracked
